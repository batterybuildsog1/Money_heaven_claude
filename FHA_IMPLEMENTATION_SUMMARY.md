# FHA Loan Calculator Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed Implementation

### 1. Core FHA Calculator (`src/lib/fha-calculator.ts`)

**Functions Implemented:**
- `calculateMaxLoanAmount()` - Calculates maximum loan based on income and DTI
- `calculateMIP()` - Calculates both upfront and monthly MIP based on LTV and loan term
- `calculatePITI()` - Calculates Principal, Interest, Taxes, Insurance + MIP
- `calculateMaxDTI()` - Applies compensating factors to base DTI (0.43 to 0.5699)
- `calculateFHALoan()` - Main calculation function
- `calculateBorrowingPowerChange()` - Real-time change calculations
- `validateFHAEligibility()` - Checks FICO and down payment requirements

**FHA Rules Implemented:**
- Minimum FICO: 580 (for 3.5% down), 500 (for 10% down)
- Minimum down payment: 3.5% or 10% based on FICO
- MIP rates based on LTV and loan term (2024 rates)
- Base DTI: 43%, max with factors: 56.99%
- 30-year term standard

### 2. DTI Compensating Factors (`src/lib/dti-factors.ts`)

**Factors Implemented:**
- **Cash Reserves** (6+ months): +3% DTI capacity
- **Minimal Payment Increase**: +2% DTI capacity  
- **Residual Income**: +2% DTI capacity
- **No Discretionary Debt**: +2% DTI capacity
- **High FICO** (740+): +2% DTI capacity
- **Large Down Payment** (10%+): +2% DTI capacity

**Functions Implemented:**
- `calculateDTIFactors()` - Main DTI calculation with all factors
- `getDTIProgressData()` - Visual progress calculation (0% to 100%)
- `getDTIRecommendations()` - Suggestions to improve DTI capacity
- Individual factor evaluation functions

### 3. FHA Loan Limits (`src/lib/fha-limits.ts`)

**2024 FHA Limits:**
- National baseline: $498,250
- High-cost ceiling: $1,149,825
- State-by-state limits
- County-specific high-cost areas
- ZIP code lookup functionality

**Functions Implemented:**
- `getFHALimitByZip()` - Get limit by ZIP code
- `getFHALimitByCounty()` - Get limit by county/state
- `validateFHALoanAmount()` - Check if loan exceeds limits
- `getAlternativeLoanPrograms()` - Suggest alternatives if over limit

### 4. Updated Types (`src/types/index.ts`)

**New FHA-Specific Types:**
- `FHALoanParams` - Input parameters for FHA calculations
- `FHALoanResult` - FHA calculation results
- `DTIFactor` - Individual compensating factor
- `DTIProgressData` - Progress bar data
- `MIPCalculation` - MIP breakdown
- `PITIBreakdown` - Payment breakdown

**Enhanced Existing Types:**
- Added FHA-specific fields to `UserInputs`
- Extended `CompensatingFactors` with FHA factors
- Enhanced `CalculationResults` with MIP, DTI breakdown, warnings

### 5. Updated Calculator Store (`src/store/calculator.ts`)

**New Store Functions:**
- `calculateFHABorrowingPower()` - Main FHA calculation
- `calculateRealTimeDTI()` - Real-time DTI updates
- `updateDTIProgress()` - Trigger DTI recalculation

**Enhanced Features:**
- Real-time calculation triggers on input changes
- DTI progress tracking
- FHA loan result storage
- Integrated compensating factors

### 6. Enhanced Calculator UI (`src/components/Calculator.tsx`)

**New UI Features:**
- Real-time DTI progress bar with visual feedback
- FHA-specific input fields (ZIP code, current housing payment)
- Compensating factors section with checkboxes and inputs
- Enhanced results display with:
  - FHA loan limits and high-cost area indicators
  - MIP breakdown (monthly and upfront)
  - PITI payment breakdown
  - DTI progression display
  - Active compensating factors chips
  - Detailed warnings and recommendations

## âœ… Key Features Delivered
